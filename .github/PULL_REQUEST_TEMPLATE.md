Thanks you for considering submitting the pull request to S3PRL!
We really appreciate it!
However, there are several steps to follow before reviewing your pull request.

S3PRL has grown too large and become too hard to maintain. In principle, we plan to keep only a few essential functionality which is guaranteed to work, instead of continually adding lots of tasks (which can be easily added but hard to keep people responsible on maintaining them in the long term. Less is more. Hence, we welcome all the bug fixes, but by default we do not accept pull requests containing lots of changes or a entirely new task, unless our core maintainers feel it is maintainable from our side. That is, we do not expect outside collaborators to maintain their contribution for a long time, which is the usual case in our experience. We wish to keep all the functionality of S3PRL work in the long term, and thanks for your kind support and understanding.

Hence, please discuss with us on the Github issue page about your "feature request" before submitting the implemented pull request, and we will first discuss about:

1. Whether we want to add it in S3PRL
2. If yes, how should we achieve this feature
3. How can we collaborate on the implementation
4. Proceed with the actual implementation and the pull request

If we did not go through this discussion, the pull request will not be dealt with and will be directly closed.
Finally, thanks again for your understanding and liking and using S3PRL!
